# demo_api
This project provides API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on a "model resource". A model represents an entity with properties like ID, title, author, and year.

With these endpoints, we can perform common operations on the model:

Creating a new model object by providing the necessary data such as ID, title, author, and year.
Retrieving all existing model objects.
Retrieving a specific model object by its unique ID.
Updating a model object by providing new data.
Deleting a model object by its ID
